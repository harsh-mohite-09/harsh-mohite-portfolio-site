#This is my personal portfolio in making.

My name is Harsh Mohite.
I am an aspiring web developer.
I am from NON-CS background and have done my bachelors in Electrical Engineering.
I find coding a lot more interesting than what I used to do in my core job.
I am on the path to be a self-taught web developer.
