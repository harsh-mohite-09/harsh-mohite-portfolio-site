# This is my personal portfolio in making.

I am an aspiring web developer.

I am from NON-CS background and have done my bachelors in Electrical Engineering.
I find coding a lot more interesting than what I used to do in my core job.

I am on the path to be a self-taught web developer. For now, I know:

1. HTML
1. CSS
1. JavaScript
1. NodeJS
1. ReactJS
1. GitHub
