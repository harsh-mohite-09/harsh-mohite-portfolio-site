          In general, electricity is thought of as something that flows through
          the conducting wires. As simple example a battery connected to a light
          bulb.

          In formal educational institution also this concept is adopted as it
          gives as an easy method to perform further calculations that are
          necesarry. However, the behaviour of electricity is not that simple.
          The physics involved in the flow of electrical energy is much more
          complex. A flow of current through a conductor involves a wave known
          as Electro-Magnetic wave.

        <p class="blog-para">
          Further more, current is usually defined as flow of electrons. But in
          real, no electron moves from its place. The flow of current is nothing
          but every electron transferring the electrical potential energy to its
          adjacent atom and this chain continues. Hence, electricity is nothing
          but flow of energy.

        <h1 class="blog-main">Gravity: Its not a force!</h1>
        <p class="blog-para">
          We are generally taught that gravity is a force. It is a force which
          keeps everything from flying away from the Earth. Newton's Gravitional
          Law states that,
        </p>
        <p class="blog-main light-1">
          <i>
            "Any particle of matter in the universe attracts any other with a
            force varying directly as the product of the masses and inversely as
            the square of the distance between them"
          </i>
        </p>
        <p class="blog-para">
          While this law explains a lot about how gravity appears to work, the
          reality is far from this. Here's when Einstein came into picture. He
          formulated his own law of gravitation which is now know as Einstein's
          theory of general relativity. It explains gravity as

            presence of matter or energy."
