          In this podcst he shares his vision about how the younger generation
          has the ability to transform India. The discussion revolves around how
          a person should approach the work he is doing with a great passion. He
          mentions the importance of the journey that one has to go through.

        <p class="blog-para">
          We generally only focus on one event. An event of success or failure.
          But life is so much more about just those events. It is more about
          what someone went through to arrive at that success. There is no
          overnight success. The outcome seems overnight but the work that has
          been put to arrive at that outcome is only known by the person who has
          done it.

        <p class="blog-para">
          He also speaks about how India is basically a status driven society
          rather than begin wealth driven. Majority of people here are busy in
          just playing the status game. Very few are focusing on the wealth
          game. To find out more about these things I suggest you watch the
          podcast.
